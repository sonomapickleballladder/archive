<li><p>Groupings can be found on the <a target="_blank" href="groups.html">Groups Page</a>. Look for them to be updated every Monday around noon or early afternoon – you will be notified (by email) as soon as they are ready.</p></li>
<li><p>Suggested playing times and locations for each group will also be posted on the <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="groups_calendar.html">Groups Calendar</a> at the same time. (You are welcome to play at a different time or location to the one suggested, provided you communicate and agree upon it with everyone else in your group).</p></li>

</ul>


<h3 class="under" id="Unforeseen-circumstances&subs">Unforeseen Circumstances & Subs:</h3>
<ul>
  <p>If one or more players in a group get sick,
  injured, or are otherwise unable to play due to exceptional circumstances,
  the following applies:</p>

     <li><p>Missing player(s) drop 2 places in the Ladder Standings for the
     following week.</p></li>
    <li><p>Remaining players can choose not to play that week (in which case
     they will all drop down 2 spots in the Standings), or they may opt to bring in
     a Sub (or multiple subs if necessary).</p></li>
     <li><p>Subs do not have to be in the Ladder, but should ideally be of a
     similar skill level.</p></li>
     <li><p>When submitting scores, please name the Sub as
     'FirstName LastName (Sub)'.</p></li>
     <li><p>Subs' scores do not count for those they are subbing in for. (Remaining players' scores count as normal).</p></li>
     <li><p>In exceptional circumstances, the Ladder administrator may allow a
     Sub's scores to count for that Sub if they were unable to play in
     their own group, but were able to fill in for a missing player in an
     adjacent group.</p></li>
   </ul>
<h3 class="under" id="Punctuality">Punctuality:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Please don’t be late! Be conscious that others in your group have arranged their schedule to play at that specific time.
If you’re late, you may be significantly inconveniencing or frustrating them.
</p></li>
<li><p>To be fair to all the other players, unless it’s an emergency, or there are extenuating circumstances, the following penalties apply for
arriving late past the scheduled start time:<br>

<p class="thin"><p><b>15-30 mins late</b> :: your opponents get a 3 point head start in every game to 11 (a 5 point head start in every game to 15).</p></p>
<p class="thin"><p><b>30-45 mins late</b> :: your opponents get an 5 point head start in every game to 11 (a 8 point head start in every game to 15).</p></p>
<p class="thin"><p><b>45+ mins late</b> :: your opponents get an 7 point head start in every game to 11 (a 11 point head start in every game to 15).</p></p>
<p class="thin"><p><b>No-show</b> :: You will not be able to play the next week.</p></p>
</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 class="under"  id="Format">Format:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><mark>Round-robin, 6 games to 11, win by 2, (don't switch – <a href="#6games">see below</a>)</mark>.</p></li>
<li><p>
<mark>If all 4 players in your group agree to it, you may play 3 games to 15 (switch at 8), or 3 games to 11 (switch at 6).</p></li>
<li><p><span id="order">The <a id="seed1" href="javascript: void (0)" onclick="this.classList.toggle('hidden'); document.getElementById('seedexp').classList.toggle('hidden'); setTimeout(function(){document.getElementById('seedexp').classList.toggle('hidden');document.getElementById('seed1').classList.toggle('hidden'); }, 10000)">#1 seed</a> <span class="hidden" id="seedexp"><b>highest ranked player</b> (order or player rankings on the <a target="_blank" href="groups.html">Groups page</a> is highest to lowest from left to right)</span> shall play with the #4 seed first game, then with the #3 seed, and lastly with the #2 seed. </span>
</p></li>
<li id="6games">In the default 6 games to 11 format, play in the <a href="#order" onclick="document.getElementById('order').style.background='lightblue'; setTimeout(function(){document.getElementById('order').style.background='inherit';}, 8000)">same specified order</a>, before repeating the sequence, and play on the opposite side of the court the second time you play with the same person.</mark></p></li>
</ul>

<h3 class="under"  id="Submitting-your-scores">Submitting Your Scores:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Please keep track of your scores after each game finishes and make sure everyone in your group agrees with them at the end of play.</p></li>
<li><p>It is every group's responsibility to submit their scores <mark>before the <a href="#weekend">end of each week</a></mark>, as they are used to form the next week's rankings.</p></li>
<li><p>Failure to do so will result in all players in the group dropping two ranking spots, (the same as if they hadn't played).</p></li>
<li><p>Since nobody wants this to happen, it is a good practice to submit them the same day right after playing.</p></li>
<li><p>To submit scores, please visit the <a target="_blank" href="scores.html">Submit Scores page</a>. You will have the choice to submit through a form submission or to enter them into the <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://cryptpad.fr/sheet/#/2/sheet/edit/OGZF7TQ5hdgy2QwmVRqx1n-f/embed/">Scores Spreadsheet</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Submitting by spreadsheet is preferable if you have access to a computer (it is not very usable on a phone). However, beware that it may take a minute to load and that you may need to press Cmd+S (Mac) or Ctrl+S (Windows/Linux) to save any changes you make if they do not appear to have saved automatically (which they should).</p></li>
<li><p>Please look at the <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://cryptpad.fr/sheet/#/2/sheet/edit/OGZF7TQ5hdgy2QwmVRqx1n-f/embed/">Scores Spreadsheet</a> every Sunday if possible to check that your group's scores appear correct. Once the next week starts, they may not be able to be changed.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="under"  id="Moving-up-or-down">Moving Up or Down:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>New rankings will be formed each week based on the previous week's results.</p></li>
<li><p>There are two operations which are performed to calculate the new rankings:</p></li></ul>
<ol>
<li><p>Firstly, the players who played that week are re-ranked based on their seed number and how they finished in their groups (see 'Players Playing Re-ranked' rows in the <a target="_blank" href="results.html">Results sheet</a>). <mark>You finish 1st(/4th) in your group by having the highest(/lowest) point differential (points won – points lost)</mark>. <p>This table below shows how you move up (←) or down (→) according to different finishes.</p>
<table>
  <tr>
<td class="head" ></td>
    <td  class="head" colspan="5">Seed</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="head" rowspan="6">Finish</td>
  </tr>

  <td class="move">1 →</td>
</tr>
</table>

<a href="javascript: void(0)" onclick="document.getElementById('logic').classList.toggle('hidden'); this.classList.toggle('hidden')"><p>Show more...</p></a>

<p class="hidden" id="logic">The logic behind the movement is that the 1st seed (highest ranked player) is expected to win the group and therefore only moves up 1 place for doing so. If the 1st seed gets last in the group however, they are losing to 3 lower ranked players and therefore should be dropped below all of them. The same concept applies for the other 3 seeds. This system allows for lots of movement when the rankings are inaccurate and less movement as the rankings start to become more accurate.</p></p></li>

<li><p>The 'Players Playing Re-ranked' list forms the basis for the next
   week's Ladder Standings, but the players who did not play that week
   will be inserted into the new Standings so that they end up 2 places lower down then they were at the start of the week. For example, if the player ranked 13th
   in the Ladder Standings does not play one week, they will be the 15th
   ranked player the next week (unseating and bumping down whoever was
   previously occupying the 15th spot in the 'Players Playing Re-ranked' list).</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>Note: When you move up, you improve your position in the Standings (your ranking), but you will not necessarily find yourself in a higher group the next week, as groups are determined by a combination of rankings and availability.</p></li>
<li class="hidden">In theory, the winner of each group would become the fourth/lowest seed in the group above, while the loser would assume the highest position in the group below. The other two players would remain in the same group, though their seedings might change based on how they do relative to each other. However, this will not always be the case, if any higher ranked players are absent that week. </p></li>
</ul>
