  <p>Welcome to the Sonoma Pickleball Ladder, a new initiative to offer
  competitive play for the many players seeking it.</p>

For anyone new to the Ladder concept:
<ul>
  <li>Ladder play is all about offering well-matched games to
  similarly-skilled players.</li>
  <li>Players who are available each week play a round-robin within a group of four.</li>
  <li>They then move up or down in the Ladder rankings based on how they finish within their group. Sooner or later, everyone should find their most appropriate place in the Ladder, leading to well-balanced matches.</li>
</ul>


  <p>I ran a beta phase of this Ladder during the summer, and am now ready
  to launch the real version and offer it to everyone.</p>


  <p>To work well, the Ladder depends on scheduling, for which I have devised a
  Calendar system. In the beta phase, using this enabled twice as many
  players to play each week as were able to with just the default time.
  Please bring your best intentions and trust in the process, and have fun!</p>


  <p>Please note, I am charging what I hope is an affordable administrative fee. This covers the time it takes me to set up
  players for participation initially, as well as to calculate results, determine groups and overlapping times, communicate with players, and update the website each week.</p>
