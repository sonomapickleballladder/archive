  <p>Welcome to the Sonoma Pickleball Ladder, an initiative to offer
  competitive play for the many players seeking it!</p>

For anyone new to the Ladder concept:
<ul>
  <li>Ladder play is all about offering well-matched games to
  similarly-skilled players.</li>
  <li>Players who are available each round play a round-robin within a group of four.</li>
  <li>They then move up or down in the Ladder rankings based on how they finish within their group. Sooner or later, everyone should find their most appropriate place in the Ladder, leading to well-balanced matches.</li>
</ul>


    <p>This current spring session will run through June 25th. The default round-length (frequency of each set of matches) will be 1 week. Certain rounds may be 2 weeks long due to local tournaments (or exceptionally bad weather), but there should still be about 6 rounds overall.</p>

   <!-- <p><i>Note: I am offering several other separate Ladders with different formats this season (in addition to the Open Ladder), which I will administrate if there is enough interest.
      (See <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="signup_form.html">Sign-up Form</a> for more details).</i></p>
   -->


  <p>Please<!--also--> note, I am charging what I hope is an affordable administrative fee. This covers the time it takes me to set up
  players for participation initially, as well as to calculate results, determine groups, communicate with players, and update certain parts of the website each round.</p>
