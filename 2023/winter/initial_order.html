    <h2>How to use:</h2>

    <p>Sign in above with the name and secret key you provided when you registered. You should then be able to move yourself up or down in the list by clicking the appropriate buttons (or pressing the arrow-up and arrow-down keys).</p>
    <p>Please be as thoughtful and accurate as possible when changing your position. Don't just look to see if you are as good as the person 5 spots above you, but also ask yourself if you would always beat the person 5 spots below you. Try to place yourself in a position where your level is between the average levels of the 5 players above and below you.</p>
    <p>Click the 'Save Order' button to save any changes you make and the 'Refresh Order' button to get the most recent version that has been saved. </p> 
    <p>Please try to make and save your edits quickly after loading the page (or refresh the order and promptly make any edits before saving). Otherwise you may be saving an an outdated version because others may have made edits in the meantime. In order to limit any 'outdatedness', the order will be automatically refreshed every minute (which means that if you have any unsaved changes, they will be lost). Please do not leave this tab open when you are not using it, so that you are not making unnecessary background queries.</p>

    <h2>Info:</h2>
    
    <p>
    The initial version of this initial starting order (which you will not be able to see once people start making edits, but which you can find <a target="_blank" href="inital_initial_order.html">here</a>), is just a ranked list based on the average of all the ratings each player submitted when signing up. Wherever there were multiple players with the same average rating, they were sorted based on when they signed up.
    </p>
   

    <h2>Color Code:</h2>
    <p>Orange: <span style="color:orange">this player has edited their position and it is higher up than it was initially.</span> <br>
        Purple: <span style="color:rgb(153, 110, 196)">this player has edited their position and it is lower down than it was initially.</span> <br>
       No highlight: this player has not edited their position or it is the same as it was initially.
    </p>


    <h2>More Info / About:</h2>
    <p>This page is the result of a whimsical idea of mine to try to implement a sort of virtual line-up. It was scrapped together rather hastily and has not been extensively tested, so it may be buggy. If it is apparent that this proccess is not working, I may close it and use a fallback method instead.</p>
