  <p>Welcome to the Sonoma Pickleball Ladder, an initiative to offer
  competitive play for the many players seeking it.</p>

For anyone new to the Ladder concept:
<ul>
  <li>Ladder play is all about offering well-matched games to
  similarly-skilled players.</li>
  <li>Players who are available each round play a round-robin within a group of four.</li>
  <li>They then move up or down in the Ladder rankings based on how they finish within their group. Sooner or later, everyone should find their most appropriate place in the Ladder, leading to well-balanced matches.</li>
</ul>


  <!--<p>The previous version of this Ladder used a Calendaring system, which I may
    return to in future iterations. But with the challenges of Winter weather, I
    am opting for a simpler approach for this season, which will use 2-week
    spans for each set of matches, and leave it up to each group to schedule their own playing time and location based on their availability and the weather.</p>-->


    <p>This current winter session will run to the beginning of April, using 2-week spans for
      each set of matches initially, and leaving it up to each group to schedule
      their own playing time and location based on their availability and the
      weather. When the weather gets more reliable and it's apparent that players
      are getting their matches scheduled in the first week, then I will notify
      everyone that we are switching to a 1-week frequency so we can get more
      rounds in.</p>



  <p>Please note, I am charging what I hope is an affordable administrative fee. This covers the time it takes me to set up
  players for participation initially, as well as to calculate results, determine groups, communicate with players, and update certain parts of the website each round.</p>
