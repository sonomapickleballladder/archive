<h3 class="under" id="When">When:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>This Winter Season starts on <span date>January 23rd</span>, and runs until the beginning of April.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 class="under"  id="Signing-up">Signing-up:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><a target="_blank" href="signup.html">Sign-up here</a></p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="under" id="Frequency">Frequency:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Play occurs once every two weeks. A <mark>round</mark> is defined as one iteration of play (two weeks in this case).</p></li>
<li><p><mark id="roundend">Every other Sunday at 9:00 <small>PM</small></mark> marks the end of each round (each two week span) and the beginning of the next.</p></li>
<li><p>Note: Once the weather starts to get more consistently sunny, I am open to changing the round length to one week, if it is apparent that groups have mostly been able to play their matches during the first week of each round.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 class="under" id="Confirming-Availability">Confirming Availability:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><p>In order to be included in the roster of players playing each round, you will need to <a target="_blank" href="confirm_availability.html">confirm your availability</a> <b>before the round starts</b> (ie. during the previous round).</p></li>
  <li><p>If you do not do so (or do not do so on time) for any given round, you will not be able to play that round.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 class="under"  id="Groupings">Groupings:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Players will be grouped in groups of 4 at the start of each round. These are determined by rankings and availability. (Note: I use the terms 'rankings' and 'Standings' interchangeably here. Ranking essentially means position in the Standings).</p>
  <p><span id="highlightthis">Group 1 will be comprised of the top 4 (4 highest-ranked) available players. Group 2 will be the next 4, and so on. (Note: if the number of available players is not a multiple of 4, the last group will have to be completed with subs).</span></p>
<li><p>Groupings can be found on the <a target="_blank" href="groups.html">Groups Page</a>. Look for them to be updated every other Monday (the first one of every round) around noon or early afternoon – you will be notified (by email) as soon as they are ready.</p></li>


</ul>

<h3 class="under" id="Scheduling">Scheduling:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Once you receive the email on the first Monday of each round that tells you that the Groups have
  been formed, you will open the <a target="_blank" href="groups.html">Groups Page</a> (the link to which will also be included in the email). Identify your group and fellow
  competitors for the current/approaching round. After having done so, please initiate communication with <b>everyone</b> in your group
  via <b>a single all-person email or text thread</b> to offer/suggest <b style="color:indigo">playing
  times and locations</b> that will work for all 4 of you, taking into account
  anticipated weather.
  Scheduling your match for sooner rather than later is better in case weather causes postponement.</p></li>

  <li><p>If you are unable to land on a viable time for all 4 of you, your group can get a
    sub (or multiple subs if necessary) to replace whoever is least available (or whoever's availability is the least in sync with everyone else's). A sub may also be called in if a player has not
    responded to the others' efforts to schedule. However, please give all players in
    your group reasonable opportunity – at least a couple of days – to communicate and offer times before proceeding to the <a href="#Subs">sub step</a>.</p></li>

    <li><p>As the Ladder Administrator, I expect all players to have respectful
      communication and to be able to resolve scheduling issues/disputes amongst
      themselves. I do not want to have to get involved! If it does reach that
      stage, please start by sharing the all-person email thread or a picture of the text thread that you have
      used to <a style="color: red" href="mailto:SPLSchedulingDisputes_Emergency_Only@riseup.net">SPLSchedulingDisputes_Emergency_Only@riseup.net</a>.</p></li>

      <li id="snotelink"><a class="" onclick="document.getElementById('snotelink').classList.toggle('h');document.getElementById('snote').classList.toggle('h');" href="#snotetop">Special note about Scheduling ➕</a></li>
<div class="h" id="snote">
<li id="snotetop"><a class="" onclick="document.getElementById('snote').classList.toggle('h');document.getElementById('snotelink').classList.toggle('h');" href="#snotetop">Special note about Scheduling ➖</a></li>
<p>Ladder play does not have to happen at off-peak hours. You are perfectly entitled to play your Ladder matches between 9am and 12pm at the public courts — i.e. during what is considered "peak time" — when there are cooler temperatures and typically less wind. So by all means offer morning times in the scheduling process.</p>

<p>At any time, if all courts are full however, please note that you must be willing to rotate off between games. And then you can rotate back on (probably within just a few minutes) to the next available court.</p>

<p>Further, the City of Santa Rosa policy is that "The courts are open for all to play on during peak hours... the courts must be shared, but it does not dictate who or how people play. [Players] must rotate off the court after one game but can rotate back in as a group ...  [The policy] acknowledges that not everyone wants to rotate in with people they do not know or people at another level of play."</p>

<p>Court capacity at Finley, especially during weekday mornings, is now substantially increased with the addition of 6 more cross-lined courts with high-quality nets available for use.</div>

</ul>


<h3 class="under" id="Unforeseen-circumstances">Unforeseen Circumstances:</h3>
<ul>
  <p>If one or more players in your group get sick,
  injured, or are otherwise unable to play due to exceptional circumstances,
  the following applies:</p>

     <li><p>The missing players drop 1 place in the Ladder Standings for the
     following round (as they would if they had otherwise not been available).</p></li>
    <li><p>The rest of you should try to a get a sub (and reschedule if necessary). If this is not possible — perhaps it is the last day of a round (hint: please don't schedule your match for the last day of a round) – 
    your group will not play and everyone in it will drop 1 spot in the Standings).</p></li>
   </ul>

<h3 class="under" id="Subs">Sub(stitute)s:</h3>
<ul>
  <p>As I'm sure you gathered from reading the above, there will inevitably be groups that end up needing subs throughout the course of the Ladder Season. </p>
  <li><p>Subs do not have to be in the Ladder, but should ideally be of a
    similar skill level.</p></li>
    <li><p>I have made a <a target="_blank" href="subs.html">Subs Page</a> to help facilitate the process of finding a sub. Anyone interested in subbing for a particular round can submit their name, and you can see everyone who is offering.</p></li>
    <li><p>When submitting scores, please name the sub as
    'FirstName LastName (Sub)' (replacing the name of the person they subbed in for in the appropriate cell of the spreadsheet if submitting via spreadsheet). Example: <i style="color:rgb(75, 100, 3)" randomname apnd=" (Sub)">John Doe (Sub)</i>.</p></li>
    <li><p>Subs' scores do not count for those they are subbing in for. (Remaining players' scores count as normal).</p></li>
    <li><p>In exceptional circumstances, I as the Ladder Administrator may allow a
    sub's scores to count for that sub if they were unable to play in
    their own group, but were able to fill in for a missing player in an
    adjacent group.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 class="under" id="Punctuality">Punctuality:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Please don’t be late! Be conscious that others in your group have arranged their schedule to play at that specific time.
If you’re late, you may be significantly inconveniencing or frustrating them.
</p></li>
<li><p>To be fair to all the other players, unless it’s an emergency, or there are extenuating circumstances, the following penalties apply for
arriving late past the scheduled start time:<br>

<p class="thin"><p><i>15-30 mins late</i> :: your opponents get a 3 point head start in every game to 11 (a 5 point head start in every game to 15).</p></p>
<p class="thin"><p><i>30-45 mins late</i> :: your opponents get an 5 point head start in every game to 11 (a 8 point head start in every game to 15).</p></p>
<p class="thin"><p><i>45+ mins late</i> :: your opponents get an 7 point head start in every game to 11 (a 11 point head start in every game to 15).</p></p>
<p class="thin"><p><i>No-show</i> :: you will not be able to play the next round.</p></p>
</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 class="under"  id="Format">Format:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Round-robin, 6 games to 11, win by 2, (don't switch sides mid-game – <a href="#6games">see below</a>)</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>
<i>If all 4 players in your group agree to it, you may play 3 games to 15 (switch sides at 8), or 3 games to 11 (switch at 6).</i></p></li>
<li><p><span id="order">The <a id="seed1" href="javascript: void (0)" onclick="this.classList.toggle('hidden'); document.getElementById('seedexp').classList.toggle('hidden'); setTimeout(function(){document.getElementById('seedexp').classList.toggle('hidden');document.getElementById('seed1').classList.toggle('hidden'); }, 10000)">#1 seed</a> <span class="hidden" id="seedexp"><b>highest ranked player</b> (order of player rankings on the <a target="_blank" href="groups.html">Groups page</a> is highest to lowest from left to right)</span> shall play with the #4 seed first game, then with the #3 seed, and lastly with the #2 seed. </span>
</p></li>
<li id="6games">In the default 6 games to 11 format, play in the <a href="#order" onclick="document.getElementById('order').style.background='lightblue'; setTimeout(function(){document.getElementById('order').style.background='inherit';}, 8000)">same specified order</a>, before repeating the sequence, and play on the opposite side of the court the second time you play with the same person.</mark></p></li>
</ul>

<h3 class="under"  id="Submitting-your-scores">Submitting Your Scores:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Please keep track of your scores after each game finishes and make sure everyone in your group agrees with them at the end of play.</p></li>
<li><p>It is every group's responsibility to submit their scores <mark>before the <a href="#roundend">end of each round</a></mark>, as they are used to form the rankings for the next round. (You may want to nominate one person from your group to do the submission).</p></li>
<li><p>Failure to do so will result in all players in the group dropping one ranking spot, (the same as if they hadn't played).</p></li>
<li><p>Since nobody wants this to happen, it is a good practice to submit them the same day right after playing.</p></li>
<li><p>To submit scores, please visit the <a target="_blank" href="scores.html">Submit Scores Page</a>. You will have the choice to submit through a form submission or to enter them into the <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="scores_spreadsheet.html">Scores Spreadsheet</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Submitting by spreadsheet is preferable if you have access to a computer (it is not very usable on a phone). However, beware that it may take a minute to load and that you may need to press Cmd+S (Mac) or Ctrl+S (Windows/Linux) to save any changes you make if they do not appear to have saved automatically (which they should).</p></li>
<li><p>Please look at the <a rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" href="scores_spreadsheet.html">Scores Spreadsheet</a> every Sunday before the start of the next round if possible to check that your group's scores appear correct. Once the next round starts, they may not be able to be changed.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="under"  id="Moving-up-or-down">Moving Up or Down:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>New rankings will be formed each round based on the previous round's results.</p></li>
<li><p>There are two operations which are performed to calculate the new rankings:</p></li></ul>
<ol>
<li><p>Firstly, the players who played that round are re-ranked based on their seed number (relative rank within group) and how they finished in their group (see 'Players Playing Re-ranked' rows in the <a target="_blank" href="results.html">Results sheet</a>). <b>You finish 1st(/4th) in your group by having the highest(/lowest) point differential (points won – points lost)</b>. <p>This table below shows how you move up (←) or down (→) according to different finishes.</p>

<a href="javascript: void(0)" onclick="document.getElementById('logic').classList.toggle('hidden'); this.classList.toggle('hidden')"><p>Show more...</p></a>

<p class="hidden" id="logic">The logic behind the movement is that the 1st seed (highest ranked player) is expected to win the group and therefore moves up less for doing so. If the 1st seed gets last in the group however, they are losing to 3 lower ranked players and therefore should be dropped below all of them. The same concept applies for the other 3 seeds. This system allows for more movement when the rankings are inaccurate and should result in less movement as the rankings start to become more accurate.</p></p></li>

<li><p>The 'Players Playing Re-ranked' list (excluding any subs) forms the basis for the next
   round's Ladder Standings, but the players who did not play that round
   will be inserted into the new Standings so that they end up 1 place lower down then they were at the start of the round. For example, if the player ranked 13th
   in the Ladder Standings does not play one round, they will be the 14th
   ranked player the next round (unseating and bumping down whoever was
   previously occupying the 14th spot in the 'Players Playing Re-ranked' list).</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>Note: When you move up, you improve your position in the Standings (your ranking), but you will not necessarily find yourself in a higher group the next round, as groups are determined by a combination of rankings and availability.</p></li>
<li class="hidden">In theory, the winner of each group would become the fourth/lowest seed in the group above, while the loser would assume the highest position in the group below. The other two players would remain in the same group, though their seedings might change based on how they do relative to each other. However, this will not always be the case, if any higher ranked players are absent that round. </p></li>
