                <summary>&nbsp;Do I have to be a certain skill level to join?</summary>
                <br>
                <span class="a">
                    No, all skill levels are welcome! Previous seasons have had players ranging from around 2.5 to 5.0+. If you are concerned that there won't be enough other players at your skill level, try to get a couple similarly-skilled players to sign up with you.</span>

                <summary>&nbsp;How much does it cost?</summary>
                <br>
                <span class="a">
                    $40 for the Open Ladder, TBD but slightly more for some of the other Ladders. (I do not want the price to be a barrier to entry, so if it is, please email me and I can probably offer you a discount).</span>

                <summary>&nbsp;Which Ladder will have the strongest players?</summary>
                <br>
                <span class="a">Probably the Open Ladder. You are welcome to email me though before signing up and ask which one the majority of players at your skill level are choosing.</span>

            <details>
                <summary>&nbsp;Where are matches played?</summary>
                <br>
                <span class="a">That is up to your group each round. Most groups choose to play at Finley, Sunrise or Howarth, and sometimes Airport Club or Lucchesi</span>

                <summary>&nbsp;Will it work for me to join the Ladder if I will be away certain weeks?</summary>
                <br>
                <span class="a">
                    Yes, absolutely! The Ladder is set up to be able to
                    accommodate players traveling.</span>

                <br>
                <span class="a">
                    Yes, you can sign up for as many as you want, as long as you intend to play in them.</span>

                <br>
                <span class="a">
                    Yes, but it's simpler if you just sign up for all the ones you wish to be in initially.</span>

                <summary>&nbsp;Can I switch Ladders later (after signing up initially)?</summary>
                <br>
                <span class="a">
                    You can if it's still before the initial registration deadline. Just email me.</span>

                    All the information you submit through the Sign-up Form is stored in an encrypted database, which only I as the administrator can access. None of it will ever be shared with or sold to any 3rd party entities. Certain information though, such as your name, email, and phone number if you choose to provide one, will be entered into a spreadsheet which is visible to the other players in whichever ladder(s) you are in.<br><br>When signing up, you are welcome to use an <a href="https://simplelogin.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">email alias</a> if you don't want your real email address to be visible. You do not have to provide your real name either if you have a very good reason not to. Please do not provide any information which would cause you alarm if someone else were to somehow get their hands on it. Your secret key should not contain any confidential information, or be the same as a password you use for any important account. If you are hesitant to provide any of the information asked for, please email me. However, most of it is necessary to run the service.</span>

                <summary>&nbsp;I am unable to log in.</summary>
                <br>
                <span class="a">Firstly, make sure you have signed up and confirmed your email address. (If you didn't receive a confirmation email upon signing up, please check that it isn't in your spam folder, and then <a href="mailto:SPLinfo+confirmationemail@riseup.net?subject=Spring Ladder |  Confirmation Email&body=Hi Theo%0AI did not receive a confirmation email in my inbox or spam folder. Could you please resend it?%0AThanks,%0AYour name">email me</a>). Then check that you are entering your <b>email</b> (not your name) and secret key exactly as you did on the Sign-up Form. If you forgot your secret key, or you think you have entered everything correctly but it still isn't working, please email me. I will send you a one-time magic link, which should get you into your dashboard. From there, you can copy your permanent login link in your 'Messages' and make note of the credentials it autofills when you open it.</span>

                <summary>&nbsp;I won my group last round. Why am I not in a higher group this round?</summary>
                <br>
                <span class="a">The group you are in is a function of your position in the standings (which will have improved after winning your group) but is also impacted by everyone else's availability (or lack thereof). If a few more players who are ranked higher than you are available this round, that will likely result in you playing a group lower than you would otherwise.</span>

            <details>
                <summary>&nbsp;Our group submitted scores but they are not showing up on the results page.</summary>
                <br>
                <span class="a">Any scores you submit via form submission (which sends me an email) I have to manually input into a separate spreadsheet, and it might take me a number of hours or sometimes even days to get around to this. When you enter the scores into the <a target="_blank" class="gray" href="scores_spreadsheet.html">scores spreadsheet</a>, they should feed directly into the results spreadsheet, but this may still take up to an hour or two.</span>
            </details>
        
            <details>
                <summary>&nbsp;How are ties broken?</summary>
                <br>
                <span class="a">
                    Any ties in overall point differential within a group will be given to the player(s) with the most games won, or if that is also the same, whoever starts out higher ranked.</span>

                <summary>&nbsp;A certain page isn't loading.</summary>
                <br>
                <span class="a">Open it on another device or in a different browser if possible. Or it may just be taking a long time to load, so try walking away for a minute and then coming back.</span>
