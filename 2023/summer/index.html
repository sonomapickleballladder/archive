  <p>Welcome to the Sonoma Pickleball Ladder, an initiative to offer
  competitive play for the many players seeking it!</p>

For anyone new to the Ladder concept:
<ul>
  <li>Ladder play is all about offering well-matched games to
  similarly-skilled players.</li>
  <li>Players who are available each round play a round-robin within a group of four.</li>
  <li>They then move up or down in the Ladder rankings based on how they finish within their group. Sooner or later, everyone should find their most appropriate place in the Ladder, leading to well-balanced matches.</li>
</ul>


    <p>This summer season will run from early-July through mid-August. The default round-length (frequency of each set of matches) will be 1 week, so there will be 6 rounds overall<span class="h" hidden> (assuming there are no extreme weather events)</span>.</p>

    
   <p><i>Note: In addition to the main Open Ladder, I am offering <a target="_blank" href="ladders_offered.html">several other separate Ladders</a> with different formats this season, which I will administrate if there is enough interest.</i></p>


  <p hidden>Please also note, I am charging what I hope is an affordable administrative fee. This covers the time it takes me to set up
  players for participation initially, as well as to calculate results, determine groups, communicate with players, and update certain parts of the website each round.</p>
